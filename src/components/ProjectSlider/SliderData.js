        made to the nwHacks 2020 competition, winning the Wolfram award. It was an app in which users would be \
        able to file daily submissions and be able to monitor their mental health, as well as receive tips for \
        how to improve it. \n I was personally responsible for the calendar portion of the project, where a user \
        would be able to select a specific day and receive their data for that day. This involved communicating \
        with the backend to recieve the user's data, as well as manage the UI/UX experience for that portion of \
        the app. \n This was programmed mainly using Java and Android Studio. We also used Google's Firebase for \
        the backend portion where we would keep user's results."

        players must work together in a fast-paced environment, and may at times get in each others way or \
        have to work together. \n I was personally in charge of coming up with the order scheduling and points \
        algorithm. This involved tasks such as generating orders and the corresponding images for those orders \
        checking for valid order submissions, and ensuring that everything was done in an efficient matter. \n \
        This project was done using primarily using C# and the Unity Development platform."
